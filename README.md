	<h1> Surfing </h1>
	<p> Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer uses a <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfboard" target="_blank">surfboard </a>
		to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards
		the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore" target="_blank"> shore. </a></p>
	<p> Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean" target="_blank">
			ocean</a> shores,
		but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake"
			target="_blank"> lakes</a>,
		in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River" target="_blank"> rivers</a> in the form of a <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_bore" target="_blank"> tidal bore </a>,
		or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_pool" target="_blank"> wave pools.</a>
	</p>
	<p> Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often
		refers
		to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.</p>
	<p> nother prominent form of surfing is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyboarding" target="_blank"> body
			boarding</a>,
		where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly,
		drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. </p>
	<p>Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standup_paddleboarding" target="_blank"> stand-up paddling</a>,
		long boarding and short boarding with several major differences including the board design and length, the
		riding style and the kind of wave that is ridden.
