    <h1>Surfing</h1>
    <p>
      Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer uses a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfboard" target="_blank"
        >surfboard
      </a>
      to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which
      usually carries the surfer towards the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore" target="_blank"> shore. </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean" target="_blank"> ocean</a>
      shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake" target="_blank"> lakes</a>,
      in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River" target="_blank"> rivers</a>
      in the form of a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_bore" target="_blank">
        tidal bore </a
      >, or in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_pool" target="_blank">
        wave pools.</a

    </p>
    <p>
      Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the
      modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a
      wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up
      surfing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another prominent form of surfing is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyboarding" target="_blank">
        body boarding</a
      >, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their
      belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even
      standing up on a body board.
    </p>

        Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are

          stand-up paddling</a
        >
        , long boarding and short boarding with several major differences
        including the board design and length, the riding style and the kind of
        wave that is ridden.

      In 2016 surfing was added by the

      (IOC) as an <strong>Olympic sport</strong> to begin at the 2020 Summer
      Olympics in Japan.[3] The first gold medalists of the Tokyo 2020 surfing
      men and women's competitions were, the Brazilian

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Many popular surfing destinations have surf schools and surf camps that
      offer lessons. Surf camps for beginners and intermediates are multi-day
      lessons that focus on surfing fundamentals. They are designed to take new
      surfers and help them become proficient riders. All-inclusive surf camps
      offer overnight accommodations, meals, lessons and surfboards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most surf lessons begin with instruction and a safety briefing on land,
      followed by instructors helping students into waves on longboards or
      "softboards". The softboard is considered the ideal surfboard for
      learning, due to the fact it is safer, and has more paddling speed and
      stability than shorter boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Funboards are also a popular shape for beginners as they combine the
      volume and stability of the longboard with the manageable size of a
      smaller surfboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      New and inexperienced surfers typically learn to catch waves on softboards
      around the 210 to 240 cm (7 to 8 ft) funboard size. Due to the softness of
      the surfboard the chance of getting injured is substantially minimized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typical surfing instruction is best-performed one-on-one, but can also be
      done in a group setting. The most popular surf locations offer perfect
      surfing conditions for beginners, as well as challenging breaks for
      advanced students. The ideal conditions for learning would be small waves
      that crumble and break softly, as opposed to the steep, fast-peeling waves
      desired by more experienced surfers. When available, a sandy seabed is
      generally safer.

    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <p>
      Surfing can be done on various equipment, including surfboards,
      longboards, stand up paddle boards (SUPs), bodyboards, wave skis,
      skimboards, kneeboards, surf mats and macca's trays. Surfboards were
      originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to 370 cm
      (12 ft) long and having a mass of 70 kg (150 lb)). Lighter balsa wood
      surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s) were a
      significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing
      maneuverability
    </p>
    <p>
      Most modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU), with one or more
      wooden strips or "stringers", fiberglass cloth, and polyester resin (PE).
      An emerging board material is epoxy resin and Expanded Polystyrene foam
      (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional PU/PE construction.
      Even newer designs incorporate materials such as carbon fiber and
      variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or
      polyester resins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since epoxy/EPS surfboards are generally lighter, they will float better
      than a traditional PU/PE board of similar size, shape and thickness. This
      makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water. However, a common
      complaint of EPS boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a
      traditional PU/PE board. For this reason, many advanced surfers prefer
      that their surfboards be made from traditional materials.
    </p>

    <h2>Surf culture</h2>
    <p>
      Surfers represent a diverse culture based on riding the waves. Some people
      practice surfing as a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation" target="_blank">
        recreational
      </a>
      activity, while others make it the central focus of their lives. Surfing
      culture in the US is most dominant in Hawaii and California, because these
      two states offer the best surfing conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, waves can be found wherever there is coastline, and a tight-knit
      yet far-reaching subculture of surfers has emerged throughout America.
      Some historical markers of the culture included the woodie, the station
      wagon used to carry surfers' boards, as well as boardshorts, the long swim
      shorts typically worn while surfing. Surfers also wear wetsuits in colder
      regions and when the seasons cool the air and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the 1960s, as surfing caught on in California, its popularity
      spread through American pop culture. Several teen movies, starting with
      the Gidget series in 1959, transformed surfing into a dream life for
      American youth. Later movies, including Beach Party (1963), Ride the Wild
      Surf (1964), and Beach Blanket Bingo (1965) promoted the California dream
      of sun and surf. Surf culture also fueled the early records of the Beach
      Boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sport is also a significant part of Australia's eastern coast
      sub-cultural life, especially in New South Wales, where the weather and
      water conditions are most favourable for surfing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sport of surfing now represents a multibillion-dollar industry,
      especially in clothing and fashion markets. Founded in 1964, the
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee"
        target="_blank"
      >
        International Surfing Association</a
      >
      (ISA) is the oldest foundation associated with surfing formed to better
      improve surfing and recognized by the International Olympic Committee as
      the leading authority on surfing.
    </p>
    <p>
      National and international surf competitions began in 1964. In addition,
      The World Surf League (WSL) was established in 1976 and promotes various
      championship tours, hosting top competitors in some of the best surf spots
      around the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small number of people make a career out of surfing by receiving
      corporate sponsorships and performing for photographers and videographers
      in far-flung destinations; they are typically referred to as freesurfers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the waves were flat, surfers persevered with sidewalk surfing, which
      is now called skateboarding. Sidewalk surfing has a similar feel to
      surfing and requires only a paved road or sidewalk. To create the feel of
      the wave, surfers even sneaked into empty backyard swimming pools to ride
      in, known as pool skating. Eventually, surfing made its way to the slopes
      with the invention of the Snurfer, later credited as the first snowboard.
      Many other board sports have been invented over the years, but all can
      trace their heritage back to surfing.
