    <h1>Surfing</h1>
    <p>
      Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer uses a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfboard" target="_blank"
        >surfboard
      </a>
      to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which
      usually carries the surfer towards the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore" target="_blank"> shore. </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean" target="_blank"> ocean</a>
      shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake" target="_blank"> lakes</a>,
      in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River" target="_blank"> rivers</a>
      in the form of a

      Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the
      modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a
      wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up
      surfing.

      nother prominent form of surfing is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyboarding" target="_blank">
        body boarding</a
      >, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their
      belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even
      standing up on a body board.

      Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are

      , long boarding and short boarding with several major differences
      including the board design and length, the riding style and the kind of
      wave that is ridden.

      In 2016 surfing was added by the

      (IOC) as an Olympic sport to begin at the 2020 Summer Olympics in
      Japan.[3] The first gold medalists of the Tokyo 2020 surfing men and
      women's competitions were, the Brazilian

    <h2>learning</h2>
    <p>
      Many popular surfing destinations have surf schools and surf camps that
      offer lessons. Surf camps for beginners and intermediates are multi-day
      lessons that focus on surfing fundamentals. They are designed to take new
      surfers and help them become proficient riders. All-inclusive surf camps
      offer overnight accommodations, meals, lessons and surfboards. Most surf
      lessons begin with instruction and a safety briefing on land, followed by
      instructors helping students into waves on longboards or "softboards". The
      softboard is considered the ideal surfboard for learning, due to the fact
      it is safer, and has more paddling speed and stability than shorter
      boards. Funboards are also a popular shape for beginners as they combine
      the volume and stability of the longboard with the manageable size of a
      smaller surfboard.[31] New and inexperienced surfers typically learn to
      catch waves on softboards around the 210 to 240 cm (7 to 8 ft) funboard
      size. Due to the softness of the surfboard the chance of getting injured
      is substantially minimized. Typical surfing instruction is best-performed
      one-on-one, but can also be done in a group setting. The most popular surf
      locations offer perfect surfing conditions for beginners, as well as
      challenging breaks for advanced students. The ideal conditions for
      learning would be small waves that crumble and break softly, as opposed to
      the steep, fast-peeling waves desired by more experienced surfers. When
      available, a sandy seabed is generally safer.
